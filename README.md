# Challenger
A project developed in vanilla PHP at a hackathon in 2013.

## The hell is this?

It is basically a platform listing different (offline) activities, where you can challenge or be challenged by people around you, that share the same passions as you.

### The idea

The idea was to offer an online place for people to hang, where they could find other (new) people with similar interests (and skills) and challenge or join them at activities they otherwise couldn't (or wouldn't like to) do alone, like play a game of basketball, billards, or just go out for a drink.

#### Pls note

Similarly to all of the code I have from hackathons, this one is also messy and incomplete as I wrote it in one day. 
I decided to use PostgreSQL for this project, don't really remember why.
